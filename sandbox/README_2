all_results old contains all results as fitted with all code without checking if the
data are actually best fit by a simple constant


fitting.py: define a function to run the fitting and calculate the onset (assumes signal is present)
            This function is the one called by the GUI 

no_gui_fitting: fitting without defining any function, this is the "parent" of run.py

run.py: script to test for presence of signal, then if the signal exist, do the fitting and print out all values

only_fitting: calculate AND PLOT the best fit, without calculating (and plotting) the construction for the onset. Used to calculate the best fit to the data
